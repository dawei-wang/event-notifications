# Working with Terraform in {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}
{: #en-tera-workwith}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-completion-time="30m"}

This tutorial shows you how to use Terraform to configure files like `provider.tf` to declare {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} resources for deployment.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #en-prereqs}

Ensure that the following prerequisites are in place:

* Install Terraform. For more information, see [Download Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
* Either deploy Terraform to a specific folder or add it to your `PATH`.

* Check your version of Terraform:

`terraform â€“version`

* You need an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account. If you don't have an account, then [Create an IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration/).
* Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account.

## Working with Terraform in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}
{: #en-work-terraform-cloud}
{: step}

Take the following steps:

1. To work with Terraform and the IBM Cloud, a plug-in is required to extend the current functionality. For more information on how to install and configure the IBM Cloud plug-in, see [terraform-provider-ibm](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm). This tutorial uses IBM Cloud Provider 1.38.2. For more information, see [IBM Cloud Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs) 
1. Create a hidden directory from the home directory:

`mkdir $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins`

1. Download and move the plug-in to the directory that you created. For more information, see [terraform-provider-ibm](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/releases):

`mv $HOME/Downloads/terraform-provider-ibm_v1.38.2 $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins/`

1. Connect to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account with {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} API Key. 
1. From [cloud.ibm.com](https://cloud.ibm.com/login) go to the **manage** tile and select **Access(IAM)** an then select **IBM Cloud API Keys**. 
1. Create an IBM Cloud API Key and save the password.

## Deploying resources
{: #en-resources-deploy}
{: step}

Create an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} resource. For more information, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-getting-started).

## Building Infrastructure-as-Code
{: #en-infrastructure-as-code}
{: step}

The `tf-template` directory contains the following Terraform configuration files:

### `provider.tf`
{: #en-provider-tf}

`provider.tf` creates the required providers.

```hcl
terraform {
   required_providers {
      ibm = {
         source = "IBM-Cloud/ibm"
         version = "1.38.2"
      }
    }
  }
```
{: codeblock}

### `variables.tf`
{: #en-variables-tf}

`variables.tf` stores passwords or other values that are required for Terraform at run time.

```hcl
variable "instance_id" {
  type        = string
  default     = "235b109c-0a2c-438b-8758-1a4b9db044db"
  description = "Event Notifications service instanceId."
}

variable "destination_name" {
  type        = string
  default     = "Smart Home Android app"
  description = "Destination name."
}

variable "destination_description" {
  type        = string
  default     = "Smart House device status"
  description = "Description for the destination."
}

variable "webhook_type" {
  default     = "webhook"
  type        = string
  description = "Type of the destination"
}

variable "webhook_verb" {
  default     = "POST"
  type        = string
  description = "Type of verb fro the destination"
}

variable "webhook_URL" {
  type        = string
  description = "URL of the webhook"
  default     = "https://hello.demo.com/hello"
}
```
{: codeblock}

The remaining files declare the resources to be deployed.

### `instance.tf`
{: #en-instance-tf}

`instance.tf` provisions an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance.

```hcl
resource "ibm_resource_instance" "terraform_demo" {
  plan     = "lite"
  location = "us-south"
  name     = "terraform_demo"
  service  = "event-notifications"
}
```
{: codeblock}

### `destinations.tf`
{: #en-destinations-tf}

`destinations.tf` uses {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} to create destinations.

```hcl
resource "ibm_en_destination" "destination1" {
  type          = var.webhook_type
  name          = var.destination_name
  description   = var.destination_description
  instance_guid = ibm_resource_instance.terraform_demo.guid
  config {
    params {
      url  = var.webhook_URL
      verb = var.webhook_verb
      custom_headers = {
        "authorization" = "secure"
      }
      sensitive_headers = ["authorization"]
    }
  }
}
```
{: codeblock}

### `topics.tf`
{: #en-topics-tf}

`topics.tf`uses {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} to create topics.

```hcl
resource "ibm_en_topic" "topic1" {
  instance_guid = ibm_resource_instance.terraform_demo.guid
  description   = "Check the status of front door"
  name          = "Front Door Status"
}
```
{: codeblock}

### `subscriptions.tf`
{: #en-subscriptions-tf}

`subscriptions.tf`uses {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} to create subscriptions.

```hcl
resource "ibm_en_subscription" "subscription1" {
  instance_guid  = ibm_resource_instance.terraform_demo.guid
  name           = "Android app Subscription"
  description    = "Subscribe to Android app"
  topic_id       = ibm_en_topic.topic1.topic_id
  destination_id = ibm_en_destination.destination1.destination_id
  attributes {
    add_notification_payload = true
    signing_enabled          = true
  }
}
```
{: codeblock}

## Running your Terraform
{: #en-execute-tf}
{: step}

Before running any Terraform scripts, learn about the following Terraform commands:

### Terraform **init**
{: #en-init-tf}

The Terraform **init** command prepares the environment by ensuring the directory is properly configured:

```bash
bash-5.1# terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of ibm-cloud/ibm from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed ibm-cloud/ibm v1.38.2

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```
{: codeblock}

### Terraform **plan**
{: #en-plan-tf}

The Terraform **plan** command compares the declared resources with the state file to print the resources to be created, altered, or destroyed. This step shows you the impact of the `main.tf` file. 

```bash
bash-5.1# terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # ibm_en_destination.destination1 will be created
  + resource "ibm_en_destination" "destination1" {
      + description        = "Smart House device status"
      + destination_id     = (known after apply)

                }
              + sensitive_headers = [
                  + "authorization",
                ]

## Exporting an API key

## Running Terraform **apply**

The Terraform **apply** command implements the changes that are declared during the **plan** step and deploys the resource to the IBM cloud.

```bash
