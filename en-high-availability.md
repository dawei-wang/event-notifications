# High availability and disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}
{: #en-ha}

{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service is a highly available, regional service that runs in multiple zones.

In each supported multizone region, every zone has its own {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes service cluster with several worker nodes. Each worker node runs several instances of {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service components. Each region is fronted by a global load balancer and a web application firewall.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service persists tenant data in a highly available database. A single regional database stores data of all the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} tenants in that particular region. The data is stored across multiple zones in each region. Data that is stored in the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service is encrypted and persisted in a database cluster that is spread across availability zones. All databases connections use TLS/SSL encryption for data in transit.

{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service is a regional service. It does not provide automated cross-regional failover or cross-regional disaster recovery. If a regional disaster occurs, all the data might not be recovered. However, a location recovery is possible and data can be restored from that location.

For regional disaster recovery, you must create and maintain backup instances in other regions. To synchronize a service instance in one region with an instance in a different region, use the APIs.

Review the API documentation and decide the data that you want backed up and restored if there is a disaster. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} API](/apidocs/event-notifications).

Some API examples are as follows:

|Entity   | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| sources | `/v1/instances/{instance_id}/sources` | Your platform sources |
| topics | `/v1/instances/{instance_id}/topics` | All registered topics |
| rules | `/v1/instances/{instance_id}/rules` | All rules created on topics |
| destinations | `/v1/instances/{instance_id}/destinations` | All registered destinations |
| subscriptions | `/v1/instances/{instance_id}/subscriptions` | All the subscriptions |
{: caption="Table 1. Example API endpoints" caption-side="top"}

For each data set that you need to back up and restore, use `GET` calls to get a copy of the data. And use the corresponding `PUT / POST API` to populate the new instance on a different region.
