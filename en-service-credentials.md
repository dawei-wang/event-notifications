# Authenticating with service credentials
{: #en-service-credentials}

You can generate a new set of credentials for cases where you want to manually connect an app or external consumer to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service. Credentials are provided in JSON format. The JSON snippet lists credentials, such as the API key and secret, and the connection information for the service.
{: shortdesc}

Services that are managed by {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) can generate a resource key, also known as a credential. Credentials are service-specific and vary based on how each service defines the credentials they need to generate. A credential might contain a username, password, hostname, port, and a URL.

Click `Service credentials` to view the existing credentials with the `Key name` and `Date created` or create a new credential.

For more information about adding and viewing a service credential, see [Adding and viewing credentials](/docs/account?topic=account-service_credentials){: external}.
